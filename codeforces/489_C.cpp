	GIVEN LENGTH AND SUM OF DIGITS

 You have a positive integer m and a non-negative integer s. Your task is
 to find the smallest and the largest of the numbers that have length m
 and sum of digits s. The required numbers should be non-negative integers
 written in the decimal base without leading zeroes.

 A pure mathematical puzzle, given s we need to break it into
 m pieces, without zeros? Zeros are an obvious choice. 

 Use greedy algorithm,
